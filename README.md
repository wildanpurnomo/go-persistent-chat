## Project setup
```
if you have golang-migrate already, you can use the makefile in following sequence:
- rename .env.template in server directory to .env
- make postgres
- make createdb
- make migrate up
- cd server => go run main.go
```

## My wish
```
eventually, I want to try create the client libraries for the service.
```
